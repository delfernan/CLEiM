# CLEiM
Cross Lingual Education in Medicine

CLEiM (Cross Lingual Education in Medicine) is an opensource version of an Intelligent System which extracts concepts from medical texts and provides qualified information. It integrates information from various sources. This system has been developed by the Intelligent System Group GSI (http://www.esi.uem.es/gsi/) at UEM University.
We do NER (Named Entity Recognition) based on GATE platform.
The installation is simple, you can use it as a Web application. It has been tested under apache-tomcat.
The original system has been successfully used to carry out active learning activities with medical students. However, it could be interesting in much more knowledge fields.
